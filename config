# THRESHOLDS DEFINITION
# Thresholds are defined in arrays
# Items are:
#  0  battery limit
#  1  message title to display
#  2  message to display
#  3  icon to display
#     either absolute or relative path to file
#     if relative, it should be in /usr/share/sng-batmon
#  4  sound to play
#     path works the same as with icon
#  5  time to display notification (in milliseconds)
#     it should be the same as the duration
#     of the sound file
#  6  check interval (in seconds)
#     time to wait between battery status check
#     if it is 0, do not wait
#     effectively displaying notification repeatedly

#  - THRESHOLD_HIGH
#    If battery percentage is lower than this, a notification
#    will be displayed and a sound will be played once
THRESHOLD_HIGH[0]=20

#  - THRESHOLD_HALT
#    If a HALT_COMMAND is defined, the PC will be halted /

#    threshold
#
#    only item 0 has any meaning here

# END OF THRESHOLDS DEFINITION

# This is the command what will play the warning message.
# Default is mpg123, since it's very light on resources.
# If empty, no sound will be played
#
# Examples:
#PLAYER_COMMAND="cvlc -q"
#PLAYER_COMMAND="ffplay -volume 100 --autoexit -nodisp -v 0 -i"
#PLAYER_COMMAND="mplayer -msglevel all=-1"
#PLAYER_COMMAND="play -q"
PLAYER_COMMAND="mpg123 -q"

# HALT COMMAND DEFINITION
# Define here the command to be used to power off your PC
# It's up to you to make sure the command can be executed
# (has the right permission etc.)
#
# Examples:
#HALT_COMMAND="xfce4-session-logout -h"
#HALT_COMMAND="xfce4-session-logout -s"
#HALT_COMMAND="xfce4-session-logout --hibernate"
#HALT_COMMAND="systemctl suspend"
#HALT_COMMAND="systemctl hibernate"
#HALT_COMMAND="systemctl hybrid-sleep"
HALT_COMMAND="systemctl poweroff"
